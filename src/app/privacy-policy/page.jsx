      <p>
        Rupeestop LLP is an information technology company. We fully recognise
        and understand the security implications of being a service provider
        with whom people trust their money. There are many safeguards we adopt
        in this regard – some of these are technical, and some are structural.
      </p>
      <p>When it comes to data security, our goal is to ensure that:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-5">
        <li>
          Your data is stored safely and securely – passwords are one-way
          encrypted before being stored in the database for high security.
        </li>
        <li>
          All communication with you, or with mutual fund companies and other
          service providers – are encrypted using the highest standards.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your data is not shared with anyone, unless you have explicitly
          requested us to do so to fulfil a transaction request.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To ensure that we achieve these goals, we have a variety of
        certifications/trust verifications in place for our firm, both from
        technical and legal/operational perspectives. All our communications are
        encrypted by 256-bit encryption, and our data is hosted with top-tier
        hosting service providers. Also, our data is continuously backed up to
        ensure continuity of operations.
